Good news! Some of our FOSS friends are starting an online reading group to work through Regina Obe and Leo Hsu's [PostGIS in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/postgis-in-action-second-edition){:target="_blank"}, pretty much *the* book for learning all the ins and outs of the popular spatial database extender for PostgreSQL. Check out their Eventbrite page to learn more!
